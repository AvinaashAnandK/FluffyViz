# FluffyViz – Plain-Language Overview

FluffyViz helps AI teams make sense of messy chatbot or agent logs. You can upload conversation exports from common platforms, and the tool automatically tidies the data so it is easy to browse and understand. Instead of wrangling spreadsheets by hand, FluffyViz spots the file format, shows a quick preview, and stores your datasets in the browser so you can return to them later.

Once your data is loaded, FluffyViz lets you add smart columns powered by large language models. With a few clicks you can generate summaries, sentiments, categories, or custom insights for every conversation. When you are satisfied, you can export the enhanced dataset and plug it into visualization tools such as Apple’s Embedding Atlas to explore patterns and share findings with your team.

The interface doubles as your control center: a sidebar keeps track of each dataset you have uploaded, and the main workspace focuses on the current file. If you want to tweak prompts or try different models, FluffyViz keeps the experience consistent so non-technical teammates can collaborate without diving into code.
