# Problem Statement
AI teams have raw agent output data but can't effectively analyze it because it lacks the structured attributes needed for meaningful pattern discovery and visualization. They need a workflow that transforms unstructured conversations into actionable insights through iterative augmentation and exploration.

# Target Users
ML Engineers & AI Product Managers who need to understand agent or GenAI features performance patterns

# Core Solution Architecture
## Workflow
```
Upload → Augment → Process → Visualize
```

Four Main Steps:
1. Upload → Raw conversational/agent output data (CSV, JSON, etc.)
2. Augment → Select from library of enrichment functions + upload custom ones
3. Process → Batch apply augmentations to add analytical columns
4. Visualize → Export enriched dataset directly to Embedding Atlas

# The tool will be called Fluffy Visualizer
