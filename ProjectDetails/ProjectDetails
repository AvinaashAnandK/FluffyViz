# Problem Statement
AI teams have raw agent output data but can't effectively analyze it because it lacks the structured attributes needed for meaningful pattern discovery and visualization. They need a workflow that transforms unstructured conversations into actionable insights through iterative augmentation and exploration.

# Target Users
ML Engineers & AI Product Managers who need to understand agent or GenAI features performance patterns

# Core Solution Architecture
## Workflow
```
Upload → Augment → Process → Visualize
```

Four Main Steps:
1. Upload → Raw conversational/agent output data (CSV, JSON, etc.)
2. Augment → Select from library of enrichment functions + upload custom ones
3. Process → Batch apply augmentations to add analytical columns
4. Visualize → Export enriched dataset directly to Embedding Atlas

# The tool will be called Fluffy Visualizer

1. Compare the upload component to the style guide @fluffy-viz/src/app/style-guide/. First from a component tailwind styling point of view and then from a UI point of view using the Chrome MCP and iteratively make the fixes such that it adheres to the style guide.
2. Incorporate the logo @FluffyVisualizer.png into the page?
3. Ensure that format detection and data preview is not persistent after dismissing the uploaded file.

I want to introduce a sidebar. Inspired by the sidebar in the dashboard block here in this shadcn implementation `https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks`. 
1. It should toggle on click, and we want to show the uploaded files. 
2. I want to save the uploaded file locally and give the option to the user to shuffle between the agent datasets that they have uploaded. 
3. Let's use #D1CCDC as the background to the sidebar. 
4. Post implementation, I want you to check with the chrome mcp and the console logs uploading each file in @fluffy-viz/public/sample-data/
